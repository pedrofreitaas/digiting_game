# Digiting pygame.

This game was made in python, using pygame.

## Concept

While playing, randomly generated enemies will appear in the screen, and each of them represent a word. If the player manage to digit the word before the dagger comes, the enemy will be killed.

```bash
There are different type of enemies.
```

## Enemies.

```python
'''
During the gameplay, there are 3 different type of enemies to encounter.
Normal enemies: this enemies are fast and they aim at you directly. So it would be better to kill them first.
Summoner: this one looks harmless, but when you encounter one, it's to kill them fast, otherwise they will summon others.
Boss: this one can tank up to three hits, but is really slower than the others.'''
```
